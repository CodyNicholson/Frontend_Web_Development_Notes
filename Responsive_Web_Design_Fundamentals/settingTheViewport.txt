To make your webpage have a nice layout on any screen size you need to set the viewport width

The viewport width tells the browser how to format the content on the webpage based on the size of the screen

To do this you need to add this <meta> tag to the <head> on your webpage:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

// Setting the viewport width equal to the device width will mean that your webpage will only be as wide as your device screen
// The "inital scale equals 1" just means that the the webpage will display at 100% of the browsers width
