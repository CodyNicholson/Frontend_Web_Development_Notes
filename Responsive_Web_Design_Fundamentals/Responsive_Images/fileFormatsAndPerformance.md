#File Sizes and Performance

###Workflow notes:

For Raster images us JPEG or WebP

For Vector images use SVG or PNG (if you have to)

-

Aim to not only have the smallest files, but also the least amount of file requests

Latency is the delay between request and responce, so if you have a lot of images, your webpage will be slower because it will have a high latency

For many webpages, bandwidth does not matter as much as latency -- in other words -- even though all the image files are very small, because there are so many of them the webpage will be slow anyway
