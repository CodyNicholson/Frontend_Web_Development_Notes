# Browser Events

A browser event is triggered when you do something on a webpage like hover over, click, type, or pretty much anything

The browser will then make an announcement of the action you just took

To see the browsers announcements you can use the monitorEvents() method in chrome tools (not available in any other browser)

You can pass variables through the monitorEvents() method to see the events related to one unique element, like if you only want to see events related to one individual text box
