$The Money Sign

Typing "jQuery" into the console and hitting enter will return: function (e,t){return new x.fn.init(e,t,r)}

Typing "$" into the console and hitting enter will also return: function (e,t){return new x.fn.init(e,t,r)}

This is because "$" is a variable mapped to the same thing as "jQuery" because "$" is easier to type than "jQuery"

The syntax for using jQuery is:

```
$(string)
$(function)
$(DOM Element)
$.ajax()
```

jQuery is a javascript library!! Not a language.
