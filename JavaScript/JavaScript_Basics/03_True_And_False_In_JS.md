# True and False in JavaScript

JavaScript has a very unique way of deciding between true and false

### A condition evaluates to true if it is

- true
- a non-zero number
- "Strings"
- objects
- arrays
- functions

### A condition evaluates to false if it is

- false
- 0
- ""
- undefined
- null
- not a number

### Example values

1 = True, since it's a non-zero number

"Awesome" = True, since it's a string

undefined = False, since it's undefined

-42 = True, since it's a non-zero number

{"state":false} = True, since it's an object

[false] = True, since it's an array
