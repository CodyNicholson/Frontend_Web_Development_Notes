#The Box Model

To view the box model inspect an element in google chrome and look for the box diagram that will be in the menu

At the center of the model you will see the dimensions of the content

Going one section further out you will see the demensions of the padding that is the space between the content and the border

Another step out will take you to the border that goes around the padding and content and is inherited from the color property of the box

Lastly, you will find the margins on the outside that will clear a space around the border between the boxes

The size of a web element is equal to the sum of the Content, Padding, and Border widths
