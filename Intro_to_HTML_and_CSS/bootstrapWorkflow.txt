Bootstrap Basics:


Make sure you have bootstrap.css and bootstap.min.js in the head of your project

A row should be of class "row"

An item in a row should be of class "col-md-X" where X is an integer 1-12 that will decide how many 12ths of the screen wide your row will occupy

For images, use the "img-responsive" class to give all your images responsive attributes defined in the bootstrap.css file


Typography in bootstrap:

You can use many different premade classes that come with bootstrap to change the layout of text on your webpage like:

.text-right, .text-left, .text-center, .font-weight-bold, .font-italic, .text-uppercase, .text-lowercase



Choosing features in Bootstrap:


Go to the getbootstrap.com/customize website to customize bootstap to include whatever features your features your project will need
