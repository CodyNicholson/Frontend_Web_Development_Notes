# TypeScript Tutorial

These are my notes from the TYpeScript tutorial I took made by Derek Banas

TypeScript brings a type system and future capabilities of JS today
 
To compile TypeScript to JavaScript you must install a compiler, Install Node at https://nodejs.org/en/
 
Check that npm is installed Windows:
npm install npm -g (As Admin)
 
Type in your terminal: npm install -g typescript
 
Compile to JS with tsc tstut.ts --target ES5
