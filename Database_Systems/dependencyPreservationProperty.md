# Dependency Preservation Property

The union over all i in {1,…,m} of the projections of F on Ri is equivalent to F

We want the set of all projections to be equivalent to F – the decomposition neither destroys any functional dependencies in F nor introduces any new ones…

We can insure that this property is preserved, but it is not automatic…
