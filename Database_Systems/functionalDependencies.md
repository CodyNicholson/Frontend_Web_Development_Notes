# Functional Dependencies

A set of attributes Y is functionally dependent  on a set of attributes X if and only if every pair of tuples that have the same values for X must also have the same values for Y

- Also “X functionally determines Y” or “X  Y”

- X is called the determinant

-

“Every pair of tuples that have the same values for X also have the same values for Y”

- For X to functionally determine Y, this condition must be satisfied by every possible relation state

- If some relation state does not satisfy the condition because two tuples have the same values on X but different values on Y, then X does not functionally determine Y
