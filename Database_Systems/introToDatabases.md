# What is a database?


Data is info that can be recorded and has known meaning
<br>
A database is an organized collection of logically related data that are typically:

- Persistent and stored on a stable medium
- Shared and have multiple uses and interested users
- Interrelated and form a bigger picture

***

### Why use a database system?
-

Early data processing systems used files of data in plain text form
<br>
Problem: program-data dependence led to limited data sharing, duplication of data, excessive time for development

***

A database uses a single repository of data accessed by multiple users

It contains info on the structure of the data

Supports different views of and concurrent access to the data

Allows sharing of and concurrent access to data

-

The costs are higher overhead for the design, implementation, and maintenance of the data

***

### Benefits:
-

- Program-data independence
- Controlled data redundancy
- Controlled access to data
- Support for multiple users
- More efficient query processing
- Faster application development

***

### Database Management Systems:
-

DBMS: Oracle, IBM DB2, MS Access/SQL Server, MySQL

We can work with a DBMS directly or through an application that supplies a particular interface (e.g., SQLDeveloper)

The database and DBMS together make up a database system
